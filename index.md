# Welcome to PUCK

This tool is developped by the [Move](https://www.lip6.fr/recherche/team.php?acronyme=MoVe) team at [UPMC](http://www.upmc.fr), Sorbonne Universit√©s.

[__Puck__](puck.md) is an architecture refatoring tool focusing on dependency breaking. It dynamically generates a dependency graph viewable in an interactive UML-like format or using our graph explorer. It currently target only java programs.

[__Weland__](weland.md) is a language interpreted by Puck to express coupling constraints. You can specify for each element of your program by whom it is accessible. You can easily browse through the constraint violations using filters based on violations sources or targets.

Stable release and last builds can be found [here](https://puckdistrib.github.io/puck/)
