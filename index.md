# Welcome to PUCK

**Puck** is developped by the [Move](https://www.lip6.fr/recherche/team.php?acronyme=MoVe) team at [LIP6](http://www.lip6.fr), [UPMC](http://www.upmc.fr), [Sorbonne Universit√©s](http://www.sorbonne-universites.fr/). List of contributors can be found [here](contributors.md).

[__Puck__](puck.md) is an architecture refatoring tool focusing on dependency breaking. It dynamically generates a dependency graph viewable in an interactive UML-like format or using our graph explorer. It currently target java programs.

[__Weland__](weland.md) is a language interpreted by Puck to express coupling constraints. You can specify for each element of your program by whom it is accessible. You can easily browse through the constraint violations using filters based on violations sources or targets.

Stable release and last builds can be found [here](https://puckdistrib.github.io/puck/)
